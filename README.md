Generating New Feature:
    <br>Run all code up to splitting data to create a new feature in the column, 'new_feature' in variable, 'data'
    
Suggestion:
    Define the data type prior to performing PCA as I did in starter file, run all the code prior to splitting data then
    try to perform PCA on data;
        <br>1. exclude new_feature
        <br>2. don't exclude new_feature
    <br>Run RandomForestClassifier on the PCs, and the new_feature if PCA was performed independent of new_feature.
